    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Garam Masala, similar but NOT identical to curry powder, can be found in East Indian food shops and sometimes in the 'Ethnic Foods' section at the supermarket. Serve hot with fried bread or rice, if desired.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite size pieces
      </li>
      <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
      <li>4 green chile peppers, chopped</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ginger garlic paste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon poppy seeds</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon garam masala</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground turmeric</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rinse chicken pieces and pat dry. Set aside. Grind poppy seeds into a
        paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet, saute onions and green chiles in oil until golden
        brown. Add ginger garlic paste and continue to saute. Add poppy seed
        paste and reserved chicken pieces, continuing to saute. Stir all
        together; after chicken is well mixed with the 'gravy', add the red
        chili powder and pour 2 cups of water over the mixture. Cover skillet
        and let simmer about 12 to 15 minutes, until chicken is cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        After chicken is 'well-boiled' (the oil should be floating on top of the
        skillet liquid), add the garam masala and turmeric powder and turn off
        the stove. Stir all together and serve.
